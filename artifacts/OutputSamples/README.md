The json files are the rugulatory rules that were extracted using my model from the streamlit UI.  
The Regulatory_Rules_20250326_010913.json(19 rules) was created using the sample instructions (present in my InputSample folder in artifacts)  
The Regulatory_Rules_20250326_003405.json(47 rules) was created using the schedule B main schedule instructions (present in my InputSample folder in artifacts)  
The Remediation_Suggestion_Sample.txt were generated using the sample instructions  
The screenshots are attached as output sample for all of the 6 components/tabs in the streamlit app  

PS: I have also attached the anomalies section of the distribution graph that was generated during the working demo (Screenshot(48).png)
