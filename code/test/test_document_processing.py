SCHEDULE Bâ€”SECURITIES

Each BHC or IHC or SLHC should submit the two schedules comprising the FRY-14 Quarterly Securities data.

UNIQUE ID

A unique identifier must be included to identify each unique record. For a given security position, the same Unique ID should be used from one period to the next.

IDENTIFIER TYPE AND IDENTIFIER VALUE

Report individual security-level data for all securities. Generally, securities should always be reported with a public identifier, if available, such as CUSIP, ISIN, or SEDOL.

PRIVATE PLACEMENT

Please enter "Y" if the security is a private placement security or "N" if it is a publicly offered security.

ACCOUNTING INTENT

Indicate whether the security is available-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity (HTM).
